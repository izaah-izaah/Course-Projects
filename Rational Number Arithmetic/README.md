New Activity Touching on Arithmetic Basics to show understang of object oriented data manipulation.
Mathematically this is a clear demonstration of how object oriented programming can use dynamic and static data manipulation.
Clearly using efficient systems like pointers to reduce time and storage capacity of machines.
