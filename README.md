# 1. Pointer Matching  Search - Arrays
Provide an array with a specific value and length to try to find them using their addresses to be more efficient in data manipulation

ðŸ’» âœ…
The pointer that is returned from the function should contain the address of
the first occurrence of the element in *arr* that has the same value as *num*, but if none exists
